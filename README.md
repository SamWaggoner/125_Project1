# 125_Project1_WordSentiments
Project 1 from Fall 2020, COS 125 with Penny Rheingans.

***Purpose***
Reads from a file of movie reviews with ratings to calculate individual word sentiments, average sentiments of words in another file, or the highest and lowest scoring words in a file.

***Instructions***
- Download Waggoner_Project1.py, movieReviews.txt, and movieReviews-small.txt
- Put the files in the same folder.
  - (If the file is in the same folder as the program, you will just write the name of the file. If it's not in the same folder, you will specify the path to the file. To write the filepath, use forward slashes.)
- Run the program, choose which task you would like to perform, input any needed words or file locations, and then read the result.
- Choose task 4 to end the program.
